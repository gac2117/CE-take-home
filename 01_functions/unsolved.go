package main

// Be sure to import "fmt" and "strconv" by uncommenting the following lines:
// import (
// 	"fmt"
// 	"strconv"
// )

// Create a function called 'greeting' that will take in three parameters: name, city, and job title.
// The function must return a string that says "Hello, my name is ______. I live in ______ and I am a ______."

// Create a function called 'getAge' that will take in one parameter: a birth year.
// The function must return a string that says "I am _____ years old."
// Hint: In order to convert the integer into a string, you must use strconv.Itoa(num).
// For example, i := strconv.Itoa(10) will assign a string of "10" to i.

// Call the function 'greeting' and 'getAge' three times using different parameters each time.

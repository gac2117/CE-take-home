	// Create a for loop that will print out the sum of the numbers between 15 and 25.
	// Hint: declare a variable called 'sum' outside of the for loop to keep track of the sum.

	// Create a for loop that will print out numbers 1 to 30.
	// If the number is divisible by 4, print out the word "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
	// Hint: Use an if/else statement inside of the for loop.
